# UsdaVisualization
The idea of this project is to implement data visualization using the USDA different reports.


STEP 1. WASDE REPORTS.

The goal is to make nice visualization using data from the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE).
The approach is to go to https://www.usda.gov/oce/commodity/wasde and download the reports in XML format.
I will start with the following commodities:

-corn

-soybean

-soybean meal

-soybeal oil

-wheat

I will start downloading data from these tables "U.S Supply and Use".


Tasks to implememnt in Flask:

-Create data visualization in Python Flask.

-Use Blueprints


Tasks to implement in Python (backend):

-Download data xml format

-Format the data

-Save dara in a database ("Probably)

-Make html table

-Make time series visualization using apexcharts javascript library

-Make gis chart


IMPORTANT

-Create Tutorial


I will be adding more tasks and STEPS in the future (I hope).
